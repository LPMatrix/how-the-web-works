The web itself is a huge and complex structure to explain. But the article is aimed at break-down every complex part into smaller understandable pieces. These pieces are listed as follows:

* Internet
* WWW / World Wide Web
* HTTP & HTTPS
* ISP
* IP Address
* Website
* Domain Name

## Internet 
Basically, the Internet is simply everyone’s computer connected together. It’s neither a corporation nor an organization, or an entity in itself. It makes use of other physical infrastructure all over the world such that it connects networks to networks. 
The major facilitator to the invention of the Internet was the US defense department who put a lot of funding into the research arm, the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) – which later changed to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). Without ARPA, the Internet as we know it now would not exist.
Without the Internet, Information on the World wide web will not be accessible. The Internet has also paved the way for computer systems to interact and share information in this modern age such as IoT, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, etc.

## WWW ( World Wide Web ) 
World Wide Web is an information system on the internet which allows documents to be connected to other documents. In essence, the world wide web is a collection of webpages found on this network of computers – your browser uses the internet to access the world wide web. The worldwide web opened up the internet to everyone. It connected the world in a way that made it much easier for people to get information, share, and communicate. It has since allowed people to share their work and thoughts through social networking sites, blogs, video sharing, and more.

## HTTP & HTTPS
HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol designed to transfer information between computers over WWW (World Wide Web). Information transferred can be anything like, document, file, image, video between computers over the internet.
HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website.HTTPS is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet. HTTPS makes a secure connection by establishing an encrypted link between the browser and the server or any two systems. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or health insurance provider.

## ISP
The term Internet Service Provider (ISP) refers to a company that provides access to the internet to both personal and business customers. ISPs make it possible for their customers to surf the web, shop online, conduct business, and connect with family and friends—all for a fee. ISPs may also provide other services including email services, domain registration, web hosting, and browser packages. An ISP may also be referred to as an Information Service Provider, a storage service provider, an Internet Service Provider (INSP), or any combination of these three based on the services the company offers.

## IP Address 
IP (Internet Protocol) Address is an address of your network hardware. It helps in connecting your computer to other devices on your network and all over the world. An IP Address is made up of numbers or characters.
An example of an IP address would be: 192.168.0.1. IP Address can also be seen as the language computer uses in communicating.
There are two IP versions: IPv4 and IPv6. IPv4 is the older version which has a space of over 4 billion IP addresses. However, the new IPv6 version can provide up to trillions of IP addresses to fulfill the needs of all internet users and devices.

There are few types of IP Address:
Private IP Address 
Public IP Address
Static/dynamic IP Address

## Website 
A website is a collection of publicly accessible, interconnected web pages. Websites can be created and maintained by an individual, group, business or organization to serve a variety of purposes. Together, all publicly accessible websites constitute the World Wide Web. 
Websites come in a nearly endless variety, including educational sites, news sites, porn sites, forums, social media sites, e-commerce sites, and so on. The pages within a website are usually a mix of text and other media. That said, there are no rules dictating the form of a website.

##Domain Name 
A domain name is your website name. A domain name is the address where Internet users can access your website. A domain name is used for finding and identifying computers on the Internet. Computers use IP addresses, which are a series of numbers. However, it is difficult for humans to remember strings of numbers. Because of this, domain names were developed and used to identify entities on the Internet rather than using IP addresses. Domain name can also be the nickname for an IP Address.
Note: No two websites can have the same domain name.
